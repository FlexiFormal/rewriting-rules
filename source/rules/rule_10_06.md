Rule 10.6: Generic Modal VP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
Mod : ''provable' | 'necessary' | 'possible' = "provable"

VP : <VP> = "contains $y$"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

"it is :Mod: that :x: :VP:"

--- Generic Modal VP Reduction

":x: :Mod: :VP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
"it is provable that $x$ contains $y$"

--- Generic Modal VP Reduction

"$x$ provably contains $y$"
```

```{rewrite-rule}
"it is necessary that $x$ solves the equation"

--- Generic Modal VP Reduction

"$x$ necessarily solves the equation"
```

```{rewrite-rule}
"it is possible $x$ entails a contradiction"

--- Generic Modal VP Reduction

"$x$ possibly entails a contradiction"
```
