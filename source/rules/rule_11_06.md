================================


```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \varphi \Rightarrow \bot = \neg \varphi$

(if {ph}`PP` then we have | {ph}`PP` entails | {ph}`PP` implies) a contradiction

it is wrong that {ph}`PP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
if $x$ is a prime number then we have a contradiction

it is wrong that $x$ is a prime number
