Rule 10.3: Modal AP Reduction
=============================


```{rewrite-rule}
it (is true | is the case | holds) that $x$ is {ph}`AP`

$x$ is {ph}`AP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that $x$ is {ph}`AP`

$x$ is not {ph}`AP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is {ph}`AP`

$x$ is provably {ph}`AP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is {ph}`AP`

$x$ is necessarily {ph}`AP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible that $x$ is {ph}`AP`

$x$ is possibly {ph}`AP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is the case that $x$ is non-empy

$x$ is non-empty
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $n$ is prime

$n$ is not prime
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is greater than $5$

$x$ is provably greater than $5$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is divisible by $3$

$x$ is necessarily divisible by $3$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ is recursively enumerable

$x$ is possibly recursively enumerable
```
