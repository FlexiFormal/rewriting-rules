Rule 10.3: Generic Modal NP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
it is $m$@(provable | necessary | possible) that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is $m$ $d$ {ph}`NP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is a large cardinal

$x$ is provably a large cardinal
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is an element of the unit circle

$x$ is necessarily an element of the unit circle
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ is a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis

$x$ is possibly a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis
```
