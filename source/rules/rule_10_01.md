Rule 10.1: Modal NP Reduction
=============================


```{rewrite-rule}
it (is true | is the case | holds) that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is $d$ {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is not $d$ {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is provably $d$ {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is necessarily $d$ {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible that $x$ is $d$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is possibly $d$ {ph}`NP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is the case that $x$ is a non-empy set

$x$ is a non-empty set
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $n$ is a prime number

$n$ is not a prime number
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is a large cardinal

$x$ is provably a large cardinal
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is an element of the unit circle

$x$ is necessarily an element of the unit circle
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ is a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis

$x$ is possibly a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis
```
