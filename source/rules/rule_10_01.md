Rule 10.1: Modal "Is"-NP Reduction
==================================


```{rewrite-rule}
it (is true | is the case | holds) that $x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that $x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is not (a | no) {ph}`NP`
```

Note that in the context of classical logic the result of the last rule can further be
reduced to `` $x$ is (not a | a) {ph}`NP` `` (cf. rule ???).

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is provably (a | no) {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is necessarily (a | no) {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible that $x$ is (a | no) {ph}`NP`

$x$ is possibly (a | no) {ph}`NP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is the case that $x$ is a non-empy set

$x$ is a non-empty set
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $n$ is a prime number

$n$ is not a prime number
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is a large cardinal

$x$ is provably a large cardinal
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is an element of the unit circle

$x$ is necessarily an element of the unit circle
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ is a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis

$x$ is possibly a counterexample of the Riemann Hypothesis
```
