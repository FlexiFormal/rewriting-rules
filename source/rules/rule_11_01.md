======================================


```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \neg \neg \varphi = \varphi$

$x$ is not no {ph}`NP`

$x$ is a {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \neg \neg \varphi = \varphi$

$x$ does not have no {ph}`NP`

$x$ has a {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \neg \neg \varphi = \varphi$

$x$ is not non-{ph}`adjective`

$x$ is {ph}`adjective`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \neg \neg \varphi = \varphi$

$x$ is not not {ph}`AP`

$x$ is {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall \varphi.\, \neg \neg \varphi = \varphi$

$x$ does not not {ph}`VP`

$x$ {ph}`VP`
```
