Rule 10.2: Modal VP Reduction
=============================


```{rewrite-rule}
it (is true | is the case | holds) that $x$ {ph}`VP`

$x$ {ph}`VP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that $x$ {ph}`VP`

$x$ does not {ph}`VP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ {ph}`VP`

$x$ provably {ph}`VP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ {ph}`VP`

$x$ necessarily {ph}`VP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible that $x$ {ph}`VP`

$x$ possibly {ph}`VP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is the case that $x$ divides $5$

$x$ divides $5$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $x$ intersects with $y$

$x$ does not intersect with $y$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ contains $y$

$x$ provably contains $y$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ solves the equation

$x$ necessarily solves the equation
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ entails a contradiction

$x$ possibly entails a contradiction
```
