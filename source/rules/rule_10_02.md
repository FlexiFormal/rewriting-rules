Rule 10.2: Modal "False"-NP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
Det : a | no = "a"

NP : <NP> = "prime number"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

"it @is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold@ that :x: is :Det: :NP:"

--- Modal "False"-NP Reduction

":x: is not :Det: :NP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
"it does not hold that $n$ is a prime number"

--- Modal "False"-NP Reduction

"$n$ is not a prime number"
```
