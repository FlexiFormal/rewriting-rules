Rule 10.2: Modal "Has"-NP Reduction
===================================


```{rewrite-rule}
it (is true | is the case | holds) that $x$ has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`

$x$ has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that $x$ has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`

$x$ does not have <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`

$x$ provably has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`

$x$ necessarily has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible that $x$ is <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`

$x$ possibly has <cardinal expression> {ph}`NP`
```


```{code-block} nbnf
<cardinal expression> = 'a'
                      | 'no'
                      | 'some'
                      | 'finitely' 'many'
                      | 'infinitely' 'many'
                      | 'countably' 'many'
                      | 'uncountably' 'many'
                      | ['exactly'] <cardinal number>
                      | 'at' 'least' <cardinal number>
                      | 'at' 'most' <cardinal number>
                      | 'less' 'than' <cardinal number>
                      | 'more' 'than' <cardinal number>
```

```{code-block} nbnf
<cardinal number> = 'zero'
                  | 'one'
                  | 'two'
                  | "$" '0' "$"
                  | "$" '1' "$"
                  | "$" '2' "$"
                  | "$" '\aleph_0' "$"
                  | "$" '\aleph_1' "$"
                  | "$" '\aleph_2' "$"
```

This listing of cardinal numbers is of course not exthaustive.
We also might have to allow any symbolic term on the RHS, as it
might – depending on the context – be provably equal to some
cardinal number.


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is the case that $x$ has exactly two elements

$x$ has exactly two elements
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $n$ has more than three prime divisor greater than $5$

$n$ does not have more than three prime divisor greater than $5$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ has countably many solutions

$x$ provably has countably many solutions
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ has no intersection with $y$

$x$ necessarily has no intersection with $y$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ has a non-empty complement

$x$ possibly has a non-empty complement
```
