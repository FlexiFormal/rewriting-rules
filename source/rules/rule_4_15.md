==================================


```{rewrite-rule}
$x$ is $d_1$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`$_1$ or ... or $x$ is $d_n$@(a | no) {ph}`NP`$_n$ (and | but) $x$ is not both $d_1$ {ph}`VP`$_1$ and ... and $d_n$ {ph}`VP`$_n$

$x$ is either $d_1$ {ph}`NP`$_1$ or ... or $d_n$ {ph}`NP`$_n$
```

Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
$x$ is a prime or $x$ is no even number but $x$ is not both a prime and no even number

$x$ is either a prime nor no even number
