Rule 11.7: Implication Introduction
===================================


```{rewrite-rule}
Prop_1, Prop_2 : <Prop> = "$x$ is greater than $1$", "$x$ is prime"

P : <Var> = "$P$"

Q : <Var> = "$Q$"

|- $\forall :P:, :Q:.\, :Q: \vee \neg :P: = :P: \Rightarrow :Q:$

":Prop_1: or it is wrong that :Prop_2:"

--- Implication Introduction

"@if :Prop_2: then | :Prop_2: implies | :Prop_2: entails@ :Prop_1:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
|- $\forall P, Q.\, Q \vee \neg P = P \Rightarrow Q$

"$x$ is greater than $1$ or it is wrong that $x$ is prime"

--- Implication Introduction

"if $x$ is a prime number then $x$ is greater than $1$"
```
