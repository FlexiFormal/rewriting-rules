==================================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`choose` a $x \in \{y \mid \varphi[y]\}$ that {ph}`VP`

{ph}`choose` a $x$ that {ph}`VP` with $\varphi[x]$
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
choose an $x \in \{z \mid z^n = 1 \text{ for some } n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that solves the equation $E$

choose an $x$ that solves the equation $E$ with $x^n = 1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$
