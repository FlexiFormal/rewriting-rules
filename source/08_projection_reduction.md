Section 8: Projection Reduction
===============================

Let $\pi_i$ denote the $i$-th projection from a Cartesian product
$A_1 \times \dots \times A_n$ to its $i$-th component $A_i$.
Applying $\beta$-reduction to such a projection applied to an
element of $A_i \times \dots \times A_n$ yields the following
rewrite rule:

```{rewrite-rule}
$\pi_i(\langle a_i, \dots, a_n\rangle)$

$a_i$
```
