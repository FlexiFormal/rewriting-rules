Rule 10.6: Generic Modal VP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`Mod` : provable | necessary | possible = {nl}`provable`

{ph}`VP` : {cat}`VP` = {nl}`contains $y$`

{ph}`x` : {cat}`Term` = {nl}`$x$`

it is {ph}`Mod` that {ph}`x` {ph}`VP`

{ph}`x` {ph}`Mod` {ph}`VP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ contains $y$

$x$ provably contains $y$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ solves the equation

$x$ necessarily solves the equation
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ entails a contradiction

$x$ possibly entails a contradiction
```
