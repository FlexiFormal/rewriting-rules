Rule 11.7: Implication Introduction
===================================


```{rewrite-rule}
${ph}`Prop_1`, {ph}`Prop_2`$ : {cat}`Prop` = {nl}`$x$ is greater than $1$`, {nl}`$x$ is prime`

{ph}`P` : {cat}`Var` = {nl}`$P$`

{ph}`Q` : {cat}`Var` = {nl}`$Q$`

$\vdash \forall {ph}`P`, {ph}`Q`.\, {ph}`Q` \vee \neg {ph}`P` = {ph}`P` \Rightarrow {ph}`Q`$

{ph}`Prop_1` or it is wrong that {ph}`Prop_2`

(if {ph}`Prop_2` then | {ph}`Prop_2` implies | {ph}`Prop_2` entails) {ph}`Prop_1`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall P, Q.\, Q \vee \neg P = P \Rightarrow Q$

$x$ is greater than $1$ or it is wrong that $x$ is prime

if $x$ is a prime number then $x$ is greater than $1$
```
