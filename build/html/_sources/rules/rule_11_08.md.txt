Rule 11.8: Contradiction Introduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`Prop` : {cat}`Prop` = {nl}`$x$ is prime`

{ph}`P` : {cat}`Var` = {nl}`$P$`

$\vdash \forall {ph}`P`.\, {ph}`P` \wedge \neg {ph}`P` = \bot$

{ph}`Prop` and it is wrong that {ph}`Prop`

we have a contradiction
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
$\vdash \forall P.\, P \wedge \neg P = \bot$

$x$ is prime and it is wrong that $x$ is prime

we have a contradiction
```
