Rule 10.9: Generic Modal AP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`Mod` : provable | necessary | possible = {nl}`provable`

{ph}`AP` : {cat}`AP` = {nl}`greater than $5$`

{ph}`x` : {cat}`Term` = {nl}`$x$`

it is {ph}`Mod` that {ph}`x` is {ph}`AP`

{ph}`x` is {ph}`Mod` {ph}`AP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it is provable that $x$ is greater than $5$

$x$ is provably greater than $5$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is necessary that $x$ is divisible by $3$

$x$ is necessarily divisible by $3$
```

```{rewrite-rule}
it is possible $x$ is recursively enumerable

$x$ is possibly recursively enumerable
```
