Rule 2.1: Adjective Variable Reduction
======================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`NP` : {cat}`NP` = {nl}`an input symbol`

{ph}`t` : {cat}`Term` = {nl}`$a$`

{ph}`AP` : {cat}`AP` = {nl}`applicable in $q$`

{ph}`NP` {ph}`t` (such that {ph}`t` is | with {ph}`t` being) {ph}`AP`

{ph}`NP` {ph}`t` that is {ph}`AP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
an input symbol $a$ such that $a$ is applicable in $q$

an input symbol $a$ that is applicable in $q$
```
