Rule 10.2: Modal "False"-NP Reduction
=====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`Det` : a | no = {nl}`a`

{ph}`NP` : {cat}`NP` = {nl}`prime number`

{ph}`x` : {cat}`Term` = {nl}`$x$`

it (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that {ph}`x` is {ph}`Det` {ph}`NP`

{ph}`x` is not {ph}`Det` {ph}`NP`
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
it does not hold that $n$ is a prime number

$n$ is not a prime number
```
