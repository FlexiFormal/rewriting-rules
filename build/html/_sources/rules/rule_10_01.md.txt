Rule 10.1: Modal "True"-NP Reduction
====================================


```{rewrite-rule}
Det : a | no = "a"

NP : <NP> = "non-empty set"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

"it @is true | is the case | holds@ that :x: is :Det: :NP:"

":x: is :Det: :NP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
"it is the case that $x$ is a non-empy set"

"$x$ is a non-empty set"
```
