Rule 4.17: "Either"-PP Aggregation
==================================


```{rewrite-rule}
VP_1, ..., VP_n : <VP> = "$x$ is prime", "$x$ and $y$ have a common divisor"

":Prop_1: or ... or :Prop_n: @(and | but)@ @(is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold)@ that both :Prop_n: and ... and that :Prop_n:"

--- "Either"-PP Aggregation

"either :Prop_1: or ... or :Prop_n:"
```

Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
"$x$ is prime or $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor but it is not the case that both $x$ is prime and $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor"

--- "Either"-PP Aggregation

"either $x$ isi prime or $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor"
```
