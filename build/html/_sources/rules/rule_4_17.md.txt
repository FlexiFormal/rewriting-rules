Rule 4.17: "Either"-PP Aggregation
==================================


```{rewrite-rule}
{ph}`VP_1`, $\ldots$, {ph}`VP_n` : {cat}`VP` = {nl}`$x$ is prime`, {nl}`$x$ and $y$ have a common divisor`

{ph}`Prop_1` or ... or {ph}`Prop_n` (and | but) (is wrong | is false | is not the case | does not hold) that both {ph}`Prop_n` and ... and that {ph}`Prop_n`

either {ph}`Prop_1` or ... or {ph}`Prop_n`
```

Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
$x$ is prime or $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor but it is not the case that both $x$ is prime and $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor

either $x$ isi prime or $x$ and $y$ have a common divisor
```
