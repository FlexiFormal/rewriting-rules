=========================================


```{rewrite-rule}
AP : <AP> = "greater than $5$"

P : <Var> = "$P$"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

|- $\forall :P:.\, \neg \neg :P: = :P:$

":x: is not not :AP:"

--- AP Double Negation Elimination

":x: is :AP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
|- $\forall P.\, \neg \neg P = P$

"$x$ is not not greater than $5$"

--- AP Double Negation Elimination

"$x$ is greater than $5$"
```
