Rule 11.2: "Has"-NP Double Negation Elimination
===============================================


```{rewrite-rule}
NP : <NP> = "element"

P : <Var> = "$P$"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

|- $\forall :P:.\, \neg \neg :P: = :P:$

":x: does not have no :NP:"

--- "Has"-NP Double Negation Elimination

":x: has a :NP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
|- $\forall P.\, \neg \neg P = P$

"$x$ does not have no element"

--- "Has"-NP Double Negation Elimination

"$x$ has an element"
```
