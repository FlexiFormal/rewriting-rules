Rule 11.5: VP Double Negation Elimination
=========================================


```{rewrite-rule}
VP : <VP> = "intersect with $y$"

P : <Var> = "$P$"

x : <Term> = "$x$"

|- $\forall :P:.\, \neg \neg :P: = :P:$

":x: does not not :VP:"

--- VP Double Negation Elimination

":x: :VP:"
```


Examples
--------

```{rewrite-rule}
|- $\forall P.\, \neg \neg P = P$

"$x$ does not not intersect with $y$"

--- VP Double Negation Elimination

"$x$ intersects with $y$"
```
